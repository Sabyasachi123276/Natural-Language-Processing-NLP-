        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field merging computer science, linguistics, and machine learning. Its main objective is to allow computers to comprehend and handle human language naturally and effectively. NLP tasks are generally divided into two key categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "**(i) Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** This focuses on interpreting and understanding human language, including tasks like speech recognition, text classification, sentiment analysis, and extracting information from text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**(ii) Natural Language Generation (NLG):** This focuses on producing human-readable text from structured data, involving tasks like text summarization, dialogue generation, and language translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:** NLP is applied in many fields, such as customer support (through chatbots and virtual assistants), content analysis (like sentiment analysis and topic modeling), and information retrieval (such as search engines and question-answering systems), among others."

        "**(iv) Gensim:** Gensim is a powerful library designed for topic modeling, offering optimized algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec. It excels in tasks such as topic discovery, text similarity analysis, and generating word embeddings for better text representation."

        "In this example, the **Gensim library** is used for both topic modeling and document clustering. We begin by preparing a list of sample documents, then create a dictionary and a document-term matrix from them. After that, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is trained, specifying how many topics we aim to identify. The `print_topics` method is used to display the discovered topics along with their associated words. Additionally, document similarity is demonstrated by converting two documents into bag-of-words vectors and calculating their cosine similarity using `gensim.matutils.cossim`. These examples provide a basic introduction to NLP with Python, setting the stage for more advanced techniques such as text generation, machine translation, and question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **coefficient values** (e.g., 0.070, 0.091, etc.) in the topics discovered by **LDA** represent the probability or weight of each word in the corresponding topic. These values indicate how relevant each word is to a given topic. For example, in Topic 0, \"artificial\", \"transforming\", \"industry\", \"intelligence\" and \"technology\" are equally important as they have equal weights i.e., 0.070. In Topic 1, \"learning\" has a weight of 0.127, which makes it even more central to this topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **cosine similarity** score of 0.289 (approximately) indicates a moderate to low level of similarity between two documents. This means the documents share some overlap in terms of words or content, but they are more different than similar."
